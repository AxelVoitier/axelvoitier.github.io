h1. Contact

You can contact me if you want to discuss about future robotics, submit me a news, send me your opinion (if you don't want to share in public comments), raise a concern, etc.

Please, avoid contacting me for questions such as "Which robot should I buy to start?" or "What programming language should I learn for robotics?" or "Which school should I go to build awesome robots?" or "Are they going to kill us all?"...
I will just not answer.

h2. Email

You can write me a mail at axel.voitier+robotics@gmail.com (or axel.voitier@cern.ch if you prefer to send your message through "professional" mail box, but that will not make any difference in the end).
